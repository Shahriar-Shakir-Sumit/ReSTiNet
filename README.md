# ReSTiNet

We propose ReSTiNet, a novel compressed convolutional neural network that addresses the issues of size, detection speed, and accuracy. 

The proposed model was trained and tested using MS COCO and Pascal VOC datasets. The resulting ReSTiNet model is 10.7 MB in size (almost five times smaller than Tiny-YOLO), but it achieves an mAP of 63.74% on PASCAL VOC and 27.3% on MS COCO datasets using Tesla k80 GPU.

Full implementation can be found here.
